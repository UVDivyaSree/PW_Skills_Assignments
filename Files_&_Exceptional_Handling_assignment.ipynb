        "\n",
        "shared_list is the shared resource between both threads. One thread adds numbers to this list, while another removes them.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Lock Mechanism:**\n",
        "\n",
        "list_lock = threading.Lock() creates a lock object. The with list_lock: statement is used to acquire the lock when either thread modifies the list, ensuring that only one thread can change the list at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Adding Numbers:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The add_to_list function adds numbers (from 1 to 5) to the list, simulating a delay with time.sleep(1) to make the multithreading behavior clearer.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Removing Numbers:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The remove_from_list function removes numbers from the list but only if the list is not empty. The delay in this function is slightly longer (time.sleep(1.5)) to simulate different processing times.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Thread Management:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Two threads are created and started, one for adding and one for removing numbers. The join() method ensures that the main program waits for both threads to complete before printing the final state of the list."
