        "#1.What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)?\n",
        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):\n",
        "\n",
        "###1.Class\n",
        "A class is like a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines the attributes (properties) and methods (behaviors) that the objects created from the class will have. Think of a class as a template, and objects are the individual instances of that template.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Attributes**: These are variables that belong to the class and describe the object’s properties.\n",
        "Methods: Functions defined inside a class, which describe the behaviors of the objects.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
        "        self.make = make  # Attribute\n",
        "        self.model = model\n",
        "        self.year = year\n",
        "\n",
        "    def start_engine(self):  # Method\n",
        "        print(f\"{self.make} {self.model} engine started.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "Here, Car is a class with attributes like make, model, and year, and a method start_engine() that prints a message when called.\n",
        "\n",
        "###2.Object\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until you create an object of that class. Objects allow us to work with the actual data stored in the class and perform actions using the methods defined within the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Instantiation**: The process of creating an object from a class is called instantiation.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```\n",
        "car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2020)  # Object of Car class\n",
        "car2 = Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\", 2021)\n",
        "\n",
        "car1.start_engine()  # Output: Toyota Corolla engine started.\n",
        "```\n",
        "Here, car1 and car2 are objects created from the Car class, and they hold different values for the attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "###3.Encapsulation\n",
        "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It also involves restricting access to some of the object's components, meaning some attributes and methods can be hidden from external access. This is achieved using access modifiers like private (denoted by __) and public.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Private** **attributes**: Attributes that cannot be accessed directly outside the class and are prefixed with two underscores (__).\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
        "        self.__make = make  # Private attribute\n",
        "        self.model = model  # Public attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "    def get_make(self):  # Getter for private attribute\n",
        "        return self.__make\n",
        "\n",
        "car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n",
        "print(car1.model)  # Output: Corolla\n",
        "print(car1.__make)  # Error: AttributeError, as __make is private\n",
        "print(car1.get_make())  # Output: Toyota\n",
        "```\n",
        "Encapsulation helps protect the integrity of the object’s data by preventing direct modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "###4.Inheritance\n",
        "Inheritance is the ability of a class (child or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (parent or base class). This allows for code reuse and makes the system easier to maintain and extend.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Parent** **Class**: The class whose properties are inherited.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Child** **Class**: The class that inherits from the parent class.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Vehicle:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
        "        self.make = make\n",
        "        self.model = model\n",
        "\n",
        "    def start_engine(self):\n",
        "        print(f\"{self.make} {self.model} engine started.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class ElectricCar(Vehicle):  # Child class inheriting from Vehicle\n",
        "    def __init__(self, make, model, battery_size):\n",
        "        super().__init__(make, model)  # Calling the parent class's constructor\n",
        "        self.battery_size = battery_size\n",
        "\n",
        "    def charge_battery(self):\n",
        "        print(f\"Charging the {self.battery_size}kWh battery.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "car1 = ElectricCar(\"Tesla\", \"Model S\", 100)\n",
        "car1.start_engine()  # Output: Tesla Model S engine started.\n",
        "car1.charge_battery()  # Output: Charging the 100kWh battery.\n",
        "```\n",
        "In this example, ElectricCar inherits from Vehicle and adds new functionality with the charge_battery() method.\n",
        "\n",
        "###5.Polymorphism\n",
        "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class. It also allows methods to be implemented differently in various classes. The term \"polymorphism\" means \"many forms,\" meaning the same function name can be used for different types of objects, enabling flexibility and reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Method Overriding**: A child class can provide its specific implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def make_sound(self):\n",
        "        pass\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def make_sound(self):\n",
        "        return \"Bark\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "    def make_sound(self):\n",
        "        return \"Meow\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Polymorphism in action\n",
        "def animal_sound(animal):  # Takes an object of type Animal\n",
        "    print(animal.make_sound())\n",
        "\n",
        "dog = Dog()\n",
        "cat = Cat()\n",
        "\n",
        "animal_sound(dog)  # Output: Bark\n",
        "animal_sound(cat)  # Output: Meow\n",
        "```\n",
        "In this example, the method make_sound() is defined in the parent class Animal but overridden in the Dog and Cat classes. The function animal_sound() can accept objects of both Dog and Cat types and call the correct version of make_sound().\n",

        "In Python, method overloading is not implemented in the same way as in some other programming languages like Java or C++. In those languages, you can define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. Python does not support this directly because it allows only one method definition for a given name in a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "###How Python Handles Method Overloading\n",
        "Instead of traditional method overloading, Python achieves similar functionality through:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Default Arguments: You can provide default values for parameters, allowing the method to be called with a varying number of arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Variable-length Arguments: Using *args and **kwargs allows you to accept a variable number of positional and keyword arguments, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Checking Argument Types: Inside a single method, you can check the types or the number of arguments to perform different actions based on the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Example of Method Overloading using Default Arguments and Type Checking\n",
        "Here's an example demonstrating these concepts:\n",
        "```\n",
        "class MathOperations:\n",
        "    def add(self, a, b=0, c=0):\n",
        "        \"\"\"Adds two or three numbers.\"\"\"\n",
        "        return a + b + c\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example usage\n",
        "math_op = MathOperations()\n",
        "\n",
        "# Calling with two arguments\n",
        "result1 = math_op.add(5, 10)       # 5 + 10 + 0 = 15\n",
        "print(f\"Result of add(5, 10): {result1}\")  # Output: 15\n",
        "\n",
        "# Calling with three arguments\n",
        "result2 = math_op.add(5, 10, 15)   # 5 + 10 + 15 = 30\n",
        "print(f\"Result of add(5, 10, 15): {result2}\")  # Output: 30\n",

        "print(f\"Result of add(5): {result3}\")  # Output: 5\n",
        "```\n",
        "###Explanation:\n",
        "1.Method Definition:\n",
        "\n",
        "The add method can take one, two, or three arguments. The second and third arguments have default values of 0, allowing the method to be called with fewer than three arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Method Calls:\n",
        "\n",
        "add(5, 10) adds two numbers (5 and 10).\n",
        "\n",
        "add(5, 10, 15) adds three numbers (5, 10, and 15).\n",
        "\n",
        "add(5) only adds one number (5) and uses the default values for the other two.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Example of Variable-length Arguments\n",
        "You can also use variable-length arguments to achieve overloading-like behavior:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "class MathOperations:\n",

        "        \"\"\"Adds any number of numbers.\"\"\"\n",
        "        return sum(args)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example usage\n",

        "# Calling with two arguments\n",
        "result1 = math_op.add(5, 10)            # 5 + 10 = 15\n",

        "\n",
        "# Calling with three arguments\n",
        "result2 = math_op.add(5, 10, 15)        # 5 + 10 + 15 = 30\n",
        "print(f\"Result of add(5, 10, 15): {result2}\")  # Output: 30\n",
        "\n",
        "# Calling with more arguments\n",
        "result3 = math_op.add(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)    # 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\n",
        "print(f\"Result of add(1, 2, 3, 4, 5): {result3}\")  # Output: 15\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "###Conclusion:\n",
        "\n",
        "While Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense, you can achieve similar behavior through default arguments, variable-length arguments, and type checking within a single method. This flexibility allows for cleaner code without needing to define multiple methods with the same name."

        "#6.Describe the five types of inheritence in Python.Provide a simple example of multiple inheritence.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, inheritance allows a class (child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent or superclass). There are several types of inheritance, each serving different purposes in object-oriented programming. Here are the five main types of inheritance in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "###1. Single Inheritance\n",
        "In single inheritance, a class (subclass) inherits from a single parent class. This is the simplest form of inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Example:\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return \"Animal speaks\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def bark(self):\n",
        "        return \"Dog barks\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Usage\n",
        "dog = Dog()\n",
        "print(dog.speak())  # Output: Animal speaks\n",
        "print(dog.bark())   # Output: Dog barks\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "###2. Multiple Inheritance\n",
        "In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This allows the subclass to inherit attributes and methods from multiple sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Example:\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Vehicle:\n",
        "    def start(self):\n",
        "        return \"Vehicle starts\"\n",
        "\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "###3. Multilevel Inheritance\n",
        "In multilevel inheritance, a class can inherit from another class, forming a chain. The derived class can inherit attributes and methods from the parent class, and also act as a parent class for another class.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Example:\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Animal:\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "###4. Hierarchical Inheritance\n",
        "In hierarchical inheritance, multiple subclasses inherit from a single parent class. This allows multiple classes to share the same base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Example:\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Animal:\n",

        "###5. Hybrid Inheritance\n",
        "Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. It can involve multiple inheritance, multilevel inheritance, etc. Hybrid inheritance can lead to complex relationships among classes.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which Python looks for a method or attribute in a hierarchy of classes when dealing with inheritance, especially in multiple inheritance scenarios. MRO defines the sequence of classes that Python traverses to find the method being called. Understanding MRO is crucial to avoiding ambiguity in method calls and to understanding how attributes are resolved in an inheritance hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How MRO Works**\n",
        "\n",
        "When you call a method on an instance of a class, Python searches for that method in the following order:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.The class of the instance itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.The parent classes in the order they are inherited.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.If a parent class also has its own parent (i.e., a grandparent), Python will continue to check those in the order defined by the class hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the case of multiple inheritance, Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the MRO, ensuring a consistent and predictable order.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example of MRO**\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s a simple example to illustrate MRO:\n",
        "```\n",
        "class A:\n",
        "    def show(self):\n",
        "        print(\"A's show() method\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class B(A):\n",
        "    def show(self):\n",
        "        print(\"B's show() method\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class C(A):\n",
        "    def show(self):\n",
        "        print(\"C's show() method\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class D(B, C):\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating an instance of D\n",
        "d = D()\n",
        "d.show()  # This will call the show() method\n",
        "\n",
        "# Retrieve the MRO for class D\n",
        "print(D.__mro__)  # Output: (<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>)\n",
        "```\n",
        "###Output:\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "B's show() method\n",
        "(<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "###Explanation:\n",
        "1.Method Call:\n",
        "\n",
        "When d.show() is called, Python first checks class D for the show() method. Since D does not have its own show() method, it looks in the MRO.\n",
        "\n",
        "According to the MRO, the next class checked is B, which has the show() method, so \"B's show() method\" is printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Retrieving MRO:\n",
        "\n",
        "You can retrieve the MRO for any class using the __mro__ attribute or by calling the mro() method:\n",
        "\n",
        "D.__mro__ gives you a tuple containing the classes in the order they are searched.\n",
        "\n",
        "Alternatively, D.mro() can also be called to get the same result.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Conclusion:\n",
        "MRO in Python helps determine the order in which classes are searched for methods and attributes in a hierarchy, especially important in multiple inheritance scenarios. It provides a systematic approach to resolving method calls and can be retrieved programmatically using __mro__ or mro(). Understanding MRO is crucial for debugging and writing effective Python code, especially in complex class hierarchies.\n",

        "###Diamond Problem in Multiple Inheritance\n",
        "The Diamond Problem occurs in object-oriented programming languages that support multiple inheritance, where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. The issue arises when two or more parent classes inherit from the same base class, and the child class inherits from these parent classes. This forms a diamond-shaped inheritance structure, leading to ambiguity in the method resolution order (MRO).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of the Diamond Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the following class hierarchy:\n",
        "\n",
        "css\n",
        "\n",
        "      A\n",
        "     / \\\n",
        "    B   C\n",
        "     \\ /\n",
        "      D\n",
        "Class B and class C both inherit from class A.\n",
        "Class D inherits from both B and C.\n",
        "\n",
        "The diamond problem occurs when class D tries to access a method or attribute defined in class A. Which path should it follow: D -> B -> A or D -> C -> A? If both B and C override a method from A, there is ambiguity about which method D should inherit.\n",
        "\n",
        "###How Python Resolves the Diamond Problem: Method Resolution Order (MRO)\n",
        "Python uses a method called C3 Linearization (also known as C3 superclass linearization) to resolve the diamond problem. This ensures a well-defined, predictable order in which classes are searched when a method or attribute is called. The method resolution order (MRO) determines the order in which Python looks for methods and attributes in the inheritance hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, you can view the MRO of a class using the __mro__ attribute or the mro() method.\n",

        "```\n",
        "###Explanation of Python's Resolution:\n",
        "When the show() method is called on an instance of D, Python looks at the MRO to determine the order in which it will search for the method.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, the MRO for class D is: D -> B -> C -> A -> object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python first looks in class D for the show() method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since D doesn't have its own show() method, it follows the MRO and checks class B, where it finds the method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, class B's show() method is called, even though class C and class A also define a show() method.\n",
        "\n",
        "###C3 Linearization Algorithm (MRO)\n",
        "Python uses C3 linearization to generate the MRO. This linearization ensures that:\n",
        "\n",
        "A class comes before its parents.\n",
        "\n",
        "The order of parents is maintained.\n",
        "\n",
        "No conflicts arise from multiple inheritance paths.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, MRO solves the diamond problem in a consistent and predictable way, ensuring that classes are resolved without ambiguity.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Conclusion\n",
        "The diamond problem refers to ambiguity in multiple inheritance when two parent classes inherit from a common ancestor, and the child class inherits from both parents. Python resolves this using the C3 Linearization algorithm, which defines a clear method resolution order (MRO). This prevents ambiguity and ensures a consistent lookup for methods and attributes in the inheritance hierarchy.\n",
